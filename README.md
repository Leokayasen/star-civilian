# Star Civilian
Pre-Alpha v0.01 - Basic python RPG with a TLI I/O

This is a side project I started in my free time at College.
It includes items, statistics and more from Star Citizen.
To put simply, this is basically what I imagine Star Citizen would be if it were a TLI-based Game.

Built purely in Python and developed in Replit.

The License is only there so I still receive original credit, if you decide to branch or modify my code.
